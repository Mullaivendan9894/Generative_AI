    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) conversational assistant for querying standards and design guidelines. It leverages the Groq Llama-3.3-70b-Specdec language model for generating detailed responses and uses HuggingFace's sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for creating document embeddings. The system processes PDF documents, stores embeddings in FAISS, and supports chat history-aware contextual queries, providing precise answers based on the uploaded documents."

He left at the end of 1920 for a \\nstudy tour in southern Europe but before long Gropius called him back \\nas his assistant. In 1924 he became technical director of the Bauhaus \\noffices in Weimar and then manager of the Gropius workshop during the \\nrebuilding of the Bauhaus in Dessau' and also taught in the department \\nof architecture at the Bauhaus. \\nIn 1926 he became professor and director of the department of archi- \\ntecture at the newly founded Building Technical College in Weimar and \\nshortly afterwards assistant director of the construction department. In \\n1930 he moved to Berlin to become head of the department of \\narchitecture at Itten, a private school of art, and started to work as a \\nfree-lance industrial architect. It was in Berlin that he brought out in 1936 \\nthe first edition of Bauentwurfslehre. \\nFollowing the war he was co-founder and member of the board of \\ndirectors of the Bund Deutscher Architekten (Federation of German \\nArchitects), was appointed professor at Darmstadf Polytechnic and \\ndirector of the Institute for Standardisation (Institut fur Baunormung) and \\ncontinued to work also as free-lance industrial architect. \\nProfessor Neufert has lectured in many cities, such as Graz, Belgrade, \\nSkople, Thessaloniki, Athens, Istanbul, Beirut, Karachi, Rangoon, Hong \\nKong, in Japan's major cities and at Neutra in Los Angeles and FL Wright \\nin Taliesin West Arizona. \\nHe is honorary member of the Real Academica de Ciencias y Artes \\nBarcelona and of the Royal Institute of British Architects, honorary \\nprofessor and doctor at the University of Lima, Peru. He has been \\nawarded the German Merit Cross with star, as well as various other \\nGerman and foreign honours \\nErnst Neufert's other works include Bauordnungslehre (1943) and \\nlndustriebauten (1973). \\nUK contributors USA contributors \\nPeter Ackroyd Dip Arch (Poly) Reg Arch The Sports Council \\nAG Aldersley-Williams MArch(MIT) RIBA Engineering Design \\nConsultants \\nNorman S Allanson Des RCA FSIAD John S Bonnington Partnership \\nDerek W Arnold ARIBA \\nNadine Beddington FRIBA FSIAD \\n(assisted by Dermot O'Brien FSIAD) \\nRobin G Booth MA MSc Dip Arch RIBA MRTPI John S Bonnington \\nPartnership \\nJan Petr Cermák-z-Uhrinova BSc(Hons) TEng(CEI) MIAgrE Scottish \\nFarm Building Investigation Unit \\nJ B Collins BSc(Eng) CEng MIEE FCIBS \\nDr Francis Duffy ARIBA Duffy Eley Giffone Worthington \\nJolyon V P Drury MA(Cantab) Dip Arch RIBA MIMH Jolyon Drury \\nConsultancy \\nNelson Foley RIBA Chief Architect Trust House Forte \\nJ A Godfrey ARIBA \\nDavid Jen kin Duffy Eley Giffone Worthington \\nEva M Jiricna DipI Eng Arch RIBA Louis Soissons Partnership \\nGeraint John Dip Arch(UCL) RIBA The Sports Council \\nGeoffrey Jones BArch(Lvpl) \\nOlwen C Marlowe ARIBA Dip LD(Dunelm) Dip TP(Birm) \\nDavid L Medd OBE Hon DSc AR IBA Department of Education & \\nScience \\nMary B Medd OBE ARIBA Department of Education & Science \\nAlan Morgan Dip Arch RIBA \\nDermot O'Brien FSIAD \\nG J P O'Neill \\nRobert Payne Duffy Eley Giffone Worthington \\nElizabeth Phillips Dip Arch RWA ARIBA \\nDennis Sharp MA AA DipI RIBA \\nDeyan Sudjic BSc Dip Arch \\nDr Martin Symes MA Dip Arch(Cantab) AA Planning Dip RIBA \\nRichard E Theakston Dip Arch RIBA John S Bonnington Partnership \\nPR Tregenza BArch MBdgSc PhD RIBA MCIBS \\nR E Vickers DLC CEng MICE British Lift Stab Ltd \\nDavid Whitham MA(Cantab) AA Dipi \\nPeter Frink BArch MSc MFA Principal !rink 8 Beuchat Architects \\nWalter Hart AlA Architect \\nWm Dudley Hunt Jr BSc BArch FAIA \\nMargaret K Hunter BA AlA Architect \\nEdgar H Hunter BA BArch AlA Architect \\nRobert T Packard BArch AlA Director AlA Documents/Architectural \\nGraphic Standards Division \\nMimi Ford Paul BA BSArch Architect \\nBradford Perkins Senior Vice President & General Manager Perkins & \\nWill Architects \\n\"),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'standards\\\\Ernst_Neufert_ARCHITECTS_DATA.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content=\"xi \\nFore word \\nArchitects' Data first appeared in English in 1970, nearly thirty- \\nfive years after Ernst Neufert published his rules for building \\ndesign' — Bauentwurfslehre — based on his lectures at the \\nBuilding Technical College in Weimar. He had arranged in one \\nbook for convenient reference during design work, data on the \\nspatial needs of man in his home, his work place and his leisure, \\nand on his animals, tools and belongings. The book clearly met a \\nneed: in 1979 the 30th German edition appeared; it has also \\nbeen published in Spanish (12 editions), Italian (5), French (5), \\nPortuguese (3), Serbocroat (3), and in Russian, Greek and Turkish; \\nbut before the present, only one edition in English, which came \\nlate on the scene. \\nIn the 1 960s the book's international repute led the Professional \\nLiterature Committee of the Royal Institute of British Architects \\nand many others to recognise the need for an English language \\nedition; but to convert to imperial measures was a great obstacle. \\nConversion to the metric system in Britain and the Commonwealth \\nchanged this. An English edition became possible. It was edited \\nby the late Rudolf Herz who had studied in Berlin and had \\npractised many years as an architect in the United Kingdom. \\nHe had no easy task. With so big a book translation alone was a \\nmajor undertaking; furthermore much terminology and some \\npractice details had to be modified. At that time, therefore, \\npublishers and editor did not try to bring the whole book up to \\ndate; they concentrated on getting it out. \\nDuring the 1 970s the need for a new edition thoroughly revised \\nbecame more pressing: there were new imperatives of energy \\nconservation, economic constraint and changing social needs to \\naffect the design of buildings. More influential still for such a \\nwork: the 'information explosion', whose full force will be felt \\nduring the 1 980s, changing the role of such a design handbook. \\nWhen he wrote Architects' Data nearly fifty years ago Neutert \\nprovided a mixture of abstracted design, principles, hard data \\nand examples. Today there is less need for illustration of con- \\nstruction details. Manufacturers increasingly distribute technical \\ninformation which can be filed in uniform office systems; and \\nwith telephone line and video display unit an office can reach vast \\ncomputerised and regularly revised data banks. To make sense \\nof this mass of information the architect now needs even clearer \\nguidance on the principles and bases of design. \\nBasis of the revision \\nOur aim, therefore, has been to simplify, rearrange and modernise. \\nRequirements or advice contained in regulations, standards and \\ncodes have for the most part been left out: they change during \\nthe life of the book and vary from country to country; moreover \\nfor legal and codified data the designer should always look to the \\noriginal source. Full references have been given. Information on \\nconstruction elements (such as foundation, brickwork, roofs) \\ncan easily be found elsewhere; it has been left out or reduced to \\nmake more room for more fundamental work on building types. \\nAt the beginning 'Basic data' summarises the essentials of the \\nhuman scale in architecture and at the end 'Components' brings \\ntogether some new European planning guidelines for the spaces \\nneeded to install, operate and maintain the often complex services \\nnow required in buildings; technical aspects of the internal \\nenvironment; and practical criteria for such components as \\nwindows, doors, stairs and elevators. Though they are not directly \\napplicable in a non-metric context we felt these pages to be of \\nwide interest in their approach to the presentation of such \\ninformation. In the body of the book the measure of what to leave \\nout, what to put in or to expand has been: does this help the \\ndesigner in solving her or his problems of spatial needs? \\nThe sequence of sections has been rearranged. All parts have \\nbeen reviewed, revised, brought up to date and in most instances \\nexpanded: this edition is twenty-five per cent longer and perhaps \\nseventy-five per cent new in substance. Special attention has \\nbeen given to new thinking on housing, education, hospitals, \\nindustrial construction and farm buildings. The section on sport \\nand leisure has been made far more comprehensive. And through- \\nout the implications of energy conservation, the needs of the \\nelderly and disabled, and defence against fire have been stressed. \\nAs the first international edition to be published the book contains \\nseveral building types which are not common in some countries. \\nBoth British and American contributors liked this. In some \\ninstances, such as shopping precincts, more than a single building \\nis involved; for these the information given is more general. In \\nothers, such as underground houses, prolects as well as finished \\nbuildings have been given as examples, although this is the \\nexception. \\nUnits of measurement \\nThe International System of Units (SI) is used for all units of \\nmeasurement. A decision on how to apply the system faces \\narchitects and engineers when drawing plans. at what point to \\nswitch from the basic mm to the derivative m. There appears to \\nbe no ruling by authority on this. In Architects' Data it is solved \\nin two ways. All linear measurements in text are given in milli- \\nmetres up to 9999, standing as here without indicator, and from \\n10 m upwards they are given in metres with the indicator m. On \\nthe other hand in the many small diagrams which form one of the \\nbook's most useful elements, four figure dimensions would \\noften make for clutter: where there is this danger, for dimensions \\nabove 999 metres are used without the indicator m. \\nThere has to be one exception to this rule. In sport international \\ndimensions standards are given: some of these are still expressed \\nin 'imperial' or US customary units. This section therefore presents \\nan unavoidable mixture. \\nTo meet the needs of users in the United States of America, who \\nare mostly still using US customary or 'imperial' units, a set of \\nconversion factors and tables is provided —.p364—81 (with a \\nsimplified version on p434). In other appropriate \\ninstances the graphic scale may be used (see below). \\nScales \\nMany of the plans and diagrams in the book do not need scales; \\ntheir purpose is to express relationships or situations. In many \\nothers the practical needs of the user are best answered by \\ngiving dimensions on the drawing. Scales are used only in \\nrelation to plans or diagrams of specific buildings or installations \\nand these are shown graphically in metres and feet. \\nStyle \\nThis book is not literature; it is a practical manual. The text is \\ntelegraphic and predicatory; in this it follows the practice of Ernst \\nNeufert, who wrote in his first edition that his aim had been to \\n'reduce, schematise, abstract the elements of design basics so \\nas to make simple imitation difficult and to oblige the user to \\ncreate form and content out of data'. The size of many of the \\ndiagrams makes necessary the use of abbreviations, these are \\ntherefore used consistently in all plans and diagrams and in \\ncaptions, the most common in the text also, the intention being \\nthat they quickly become familiar to the user. Abbreviations used \\nin the book (—pxiii) are also listed forquickreferenceon \\np434 which carries the conversion tables and factors. \\nLanguage is a usual problem in a book intended for users both \\n\"),\n",

Sometimes it \\nis possible to find a neutral alternative expression; at others we \\nhave risked annoying everybody occasionally by choosing a \\nword from one or the other usage: thus the British have to accept \\naisle', 'elevator' truck'; North Americans must stomach 'foot- \\npath', 'ground floor' for 'first floor' (and 'second' for 'first' . . \\n'cooker' for 'range' (which has a limited specific meaning in the \\nUnited Kingdom). Only rarely have we fallen back on using a \\ndouble expression such as 'trolley (cart)'. North American readers \\nare also asked to accept that British spelling has been used all \\nthrough. \\nDistantly related is the problem of the rule of the road. Quite a \\nnumber of illustrations show access roads, car parking, turning \\ncircles and such details.

Common \\nunits like the inch — twelfth part of the foot, palm, hand, span, cubit — \\nlength of the forearm, eli — outstretched arm, yard — pace are directly \\nrelated to dimensions of the body. Other units (pole, furlong, mile — \\npound, stone, bushel etc) have their basis in human activities. \\nWhile trade was largely local and manufacture on a craft basis, local \\nvariations in measurements were of limited importance. The growth of \\nscience and technology, and the establishment of centralised states, \\ntypified in 18th century France, led to a demand for rationalisaf ion of \\nweights and measures. This the metric system, first adopted in 1790, \\nmet. It had a geodetic and decimal base, divorced from human dimen- \\nsions and from the duodecimal bases of many earlier systems \\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, the metric system went \\nthrough several refinements as scientific knowledge about the physical \\nworld progressed. Out of these refinements arose the 'Système Inter- \\nnational d'Unités' (SI) now almost universally adopted.

The change to SI which took place in the UK —and many other \\nEnglish-speaking countries — in the 1970s stimulated a fresh look at \\nuser requirements and their dimensional framework.

Indices to cover different aspects \\nof lighting have been developed. They distinguish between artificial and \\nday lighting. \\nArtificial lighting \\nImportant are quantity of light (illuminance) and glare, also reflectances \\nof surfaces being lit —.p25—6 398. The task, and its relative importance \\nagainst lighting its background and the whole space, determine Ilumi- \\nnance. Design illuminances, w mean illuminance over mainfenance \\ncycle of lighting system, for common tasks —.(1). \\nVisibility of task depends on direction of incident light as well as quantity \\nHarsh shadows, and glare from bright or very bright light source or its \\nreflection, undesirable. Glare can impair vision. But some shadowing \\nhelps perception of textures and shapes. \\nDiscomfort glare arises when luminaires and other sources of light too \\nbright in contrast with general background. Degree of discomfort indi- \\ncated by glare index, recommended max values being determined by \\ntask: the more demanding the task the lower the value acceptable —(2) \\nSurface reflectances and colour of surfaces affect general brightness \\nand distribution of light in rm, \\nDaylighting —*p27—32 \\nWindows in bldg have 2 main visual functions: to let light in during \\ndaylight hours and to enable people to see out — or in. They permit entry \\ninto a bldg of solar energy direct, by absorption and reradiation by \\natmosphere, and by reflection from sunlit surfaces. Windows also source \\nof heat loss. Choice of window basic to architectural design - .p4O3—6 \\nAs source of illumination daylight has many pleasant directional qualities. \\nIts quantity varies with outside conditions and is specified in terms of \\nDF; ie ratio of infernal to external daylight levels —.p26—7.

Good colouring and good lighting \\ninterdependent. \\nCommon practice of describing colours by arbitrary names deprecated. \\nSeveral systems for classifying colours. One such, standardised by \\nCIE, based on 3 physical attributes (wavelength, purify, luminance), \\nwidely used in colour lab but less suitable for architectural design than \\nAmerican Munsell system, based on 'value' (lightness).

Patterns \\nlarge in scale, with clearly distinguishable elements, allow each element \\nto be related to an individual colour. But if pattern small-scale, only \\ndominant or composite colour stands out. As scale reduced, eg by \\nincreasing viewing distance, strong contrasts in colour lose effectiveness. \\nChanges in appearance with distance valued characteristic of such \\nnatural materials as marbles, grained timber, multi-coloured brickwork. \\nSubtleties of colour and texture, apparent close to, give way to overall \\npattern viewed at middle distance. At still greater, become fused into 1 \\ncomposite colour. \\nNOISE & ACOUSTICS \\nHigh levels of noise can lead to damage to hearing. At lower levels noise \\ninterferes with verbal communication. At still lower levels noise may be \\ndisturbing or annoying. Acoustic design controls intrusive noise and by \\nchoice of materials, dimensions and shape of auditorium speech and/or \\nmusic to be enjoyed. \\nMany noise indices available for predicting noise effects. For many bldg \\nand environmental situations equivalent continuous sound level (Leq) \\nexpressed in dB(A) is adequate predictor. Exposure to high levels on \\nnoise results in hazard to hearing. Upper limit of 90 dB(A) Leq has been \\nsuggested for 8-hour working day. \\nInterference with speech communication from intrusive noise depends \\non distance between talker and listener, and on whether voice normal or \\nraised —n(2). \\nDegree of annoyance from intrusive noise depends on number of \\nfactors, particularly type of use and task being carried out—.(3). \\nSound insulation —np395—7 \\nSENSITIVITY TO VIBRATION \\nFrequencies of vibrations encountered in bldg lie mostly in range 5—50 \\nHz.

Such cases usually resolved by common sense; little to be \\ngained from calculation techniques. \\nDegree of discomfort glare can be assessed numerically and expressed \\nas limiting glare index. (—oBib367 382). Main controlling parameter \\nluminance of sky as seen through window; above low value of window/ \\nfloor area ratio (l—2%) size of window not important. Recent studies \\nindicate, for example, that if one assumes sky luminance of 8900 cd/rn2 \\n(exceeded for only about 15% of working year) predicted glare index for \\nrm not exceeding 4000 in height with av surface relectances of 0.4 \\nwould be 26. For similar rm with av reflectances of 0.6 glare index would \\nbe 24. These figures apply to worst conditions, eg single window facing \\nobserver. For progressive reductions in sky luminance predicted glare \\nindices would be reduced; eg with sky luminance of 6400 cd/m2 glare \\nindex would be reduced by 0.5 units and for sky luminance of 1 600 \\ncd/rn2 by as much as 4 units, bearing in mind that incidence of glare \\nwould be increased because of higher proportion of working hours for \\nassumed lower sky uminace. Conversely, for rm with higher ceilings (le \\nabove 4000) glare index may well be increased by 1—2 units. \\nAs controlling factor is sky luminance, if values assumed for glare \\nindices are greater than recommended values —.(2) some amelioration \\nlikely to be required. Practical ameliorative measures include use of \\ntranslucent curtains or blinds, louvred or slatted blinds, vertical or hori- \\nzontal fins and high infernal surface reflectances —vp406.

Simple (need not have resident warden) mm 2.04 m2/bed \\nspace; standard (must have resident warden living within curtilage of \\nhostel at all times when open to members) for dormitories mm 2.32 \\nm2/bed space, recommended 2.78 m2. As double bunks normally used \\nthis means 6.31 m2/bunk if DES standards to be met. \\nDormitories \\nYHA, ruling body for hostels in England and Wales (Scottish YHA has \\nsimilar standards), lays down all hostels must have separate dormitories \\nfor men and women, with separate access. Layout of dormitories should \\nbe such that can be used by either sex as bookings demand: means that \\neither sex must be able to reach appropriate lavatory.

Members' \\nkitchens have combined double cooking rings and burners and grill \\nunits, fuelled by propane gas where mains services not available. Locker \\nspace also required, and also washing up space, in addition to that \\nintended for those hostellers who take warden's meals who are required \\nto wash up. \\nWarden's quarters \\nHostels with more than 40 beds usually administered by married couples, \\npossibly with children who will need living quarters. Largest hostels will \\nhave assistant wardens, provided with own sitting rm, staff dining rm, \\nkitchens and recreation rm. \\nIn larger hostels chief warden's quarters should be in form of self- \\ncontained house or flat, with 3 bedr, bathr, kitchen, dining rm and sitting \\nrm.

Current trend in UK towards larger central \\nlibraries with branch satellites; rural areas often served by mobile units. \\nSpecialised: primarily used for reference, with small loan section. \\nNational university: used for reference and research; continually growing collections. \\nSee also school media centres —*pl 29, hospital libraries —*pl 77. \\nIncreasing literacy and leisure time plus information explosion' make it \\nimportant to plan for max flexibility and for future expansion. New \\ntechniques are changing methods of control/indexing/retrieval. \\nPATTERN \\n3 main elements, materials, readers, staff, are related in varying ways \\ndepending on organisation policy: eg community, school and hospital \\nlibraries require predominantly 'open access', ie readers have direct \\naccess to books; catalogue a necessary adjunct. At times large numbers \\nof people circulate among spread-out shelving units and are attracted to \\nbrowse. \\nLarger libraries including universities and colleges concentrate sto in \\n'open stack' and put reading spaces nearby rather than amongst shelving. \\nFormal arrangement of this often used in USA. \\nAlternative 'closed acess' allows no contact between readers and books \\nexcept through staff via catalogue. This method used for major sto in \\nnational, large city and county reference collections, for rare and valuable \\nbooks and as 'back-up' sto in any library: 'closed stack'. \\nSpecialised/large libraries may have separate subject dept each with \\nenquiry service; catalogue should remain centralised unless computer based. Reference and loan section catalogues may be divided. \\nSPACE STANDARDS \\nAppreciable differences to be found among national and international \\nauthorities.

Lobby should reduce entry of noise/draughts. Provide visual \\nstimulation here. Adequate control needed to prevent high losses of \\nbooks etc through exit: some have had to use turnstiles or electronic \\ndetectors. Remember needs of disabled people (ramps/elevator! \\nescalator —.p85—7 407 408 412). Should lead to control/guide area \\n—*below, with display en route. \\nCONTROL AREA \\nClose to or within sight of bldg entrance, and with space to absorb \\ncongestion at peak hours, but located to allow max visibility for super- \\nvision. Function: to register new readers, issue and receive loan books, \\ndeal with reservations and fines. In small libraries also handles reader's \\nenquiries —(1 )—(3). \\nGUIDE AREA \\nCard index/book sheaves/computer print-out books, located near control \\nor enquiry, en route to all dept served, also close to catalogue work area. \\nIf card index, allow say 12 m2 covering 36000 vol. \\nENQUIRY DESK \\nNear catalogue guide and bibliographies. Can help to share supervision \\nwith control. \\nMATERIALS \\nBooks are, and will continue to be, primary material. Space may also be \\nrequired for: newspapers and periodicals, discs, tapes and music scores, \\nmicrofilms, maps and pictures; there may be more to add in future: \\nflexibility of layout necessary. \\nShelving units \\nMost widely used type is metal shelving, individually adjustable, single \\nsided (along walls) and double sided (island). Unit height 2000 (loan \\narea), 1 500 (children's area), 2300 (bookstack areas). Shelf depth \\n200—300 (children's books), 200 (fiction, literature, history, politics, \\neconomics, law), 300 (scientific, technical, med). Width of unit generally \\n900 in UK and USA. Main routes in open access' areas 1 800 clear \\nwidth, and minor routes 1 200. \\nBook stacks \\nOptimum length of shelving 6 units (5400) to max 8 units (7200) but 4 \\nunits (3600) where accessible only from 1 end. \\nCentres of islands where open stack' are 1 280—1 520 (gives about 164 \\nvol/rn2); where 'closed stack' centres are 1 060—1 280 (gives 200—215 \\nvol/rn2). Choice between these limits depends on selection of shelf \\ndepths and aisle widths. \\nDerivations from stack centre figures will give choice of economic \\nstructural grid dimensions at centres of 5400,6000, 6850, 7310,7620, \\n7750 and 8350. Sub-divisions of these figures will relate-windows, roof \\nlights, fixed elements, ventilation and lighting. Optimum column sizes \\nshould be contained within 450 x 450 less finishes and tolerances, \\nclear ceiling height approx 2400. \\nLoad-bearing stack units no longer favoured. Multi-floor 'closed stacks' \\ninhibit flexibility and require book hoist with staff captive on each floor. \\nLarge area stack more flexible; max horizontal distance from bookshelf \\nto exit or book elevator approx 33 m: may need mech conveyors. \\nVariation for 'closed stack' sto: compact moveable shelving, of which \\nmost common is 'right angle roller' type. Saves 5O% of floor space \\ncompared with static units but expensive and creates extra floor loading. \\nSpace saving of 40% if aisles in static shelving were reduced from 900 \\nto 550 wide. \\nConsider dividing into fr compartments of about 450 m2. Use temp or \\nsmoke detectors, not sprinkler system (causes more damage than fire). \\nReading/study \\nWork table of 900 x 600/reader who should sit facing low screen \\npossibly with built- in light. Student should have 2.32 m2 (which includes \\ncirculation space), screened on 3 sides (open carrel); research worker \\n3.0 m2 or more screened on 4 sides (enclosed carrel). Aim give sufficient \\nprivacy for mental concentration yet open enough to know if space \\noccupied and not misused. Lockable cupboards where books reserved \\nthere for periods. \\nIn community libraries trend away from formal reading rm towards small \\nscattered alcoves and nooks. In university libraries either large reading \\nrm separated from books stacks or, more commonly in UK, reading \\nareas round perimeter of stack areas, with further seating within stacks. \\nreturned \\nP4,, \\nout \\nTuII \\n'I \\n< 'I '1 ,' , \\nI I \\n1'ir, \\n1 Small lib, staff of 1; snag: cross \\ncirculation \\n2 Island control, 1 staff at off-peak; \\nsnag: separation from other staff ar \\nreturned I out \\nboOks \\nTJ \\nI \\n)1r1 / II I I \\n/ I \\n' \\n(i__i \\n3 Large lib, can adjoin other staff \\nwork ar; snag: mm 2 staff all times \\n4 Metropolitan Toronto lib, largest public in Canada, houses over 1.25 \\nmillion books, one third on display; space for over 800 readers to study mostly \\nin ar with some natural light \\nkey \\n1 information 2 gailery 3 synthesis 4 eritended hours reading 5 metro information services \\n6 newspapers 7 snacics 8 rneeflng 9 sto 10 audio visual services 11 general reference & information \\ncentre l2circuiation 13 him stack l4graphics lsbibhographicai centre 16 senidEng & receiving \\n\"),\n",

Under direction Dept of Health & Social Service \\n(DHSS) or Scottish Home & Health Dept service organised into 3 tiers; \\nregional, area and health districts. Broad planning, design and construc- \\ntion new bldg falls to regional authorities (RHA: in Scotland area health \\nboards) while health districts (HD) serving 100000—500000 population \\nhave immediate control individual hospitals, clinics and health centres \\n(HC). NHS in England to be restructured 1982 to only 2 tiers: existing \\nRHAs and new District Health Authorities (DHA). \\nTraditionally in USA health care industry much more varied with health \\nservices provided by private, educational and religious sources, com- \\nmunity, state and federal bodies. More recently position modified by \\nNational Health Planning & Resources Development Act 1974 which \\ngreatly increased influence of federal agencies, providing for national \\nguidelines for health planning and for setting up in each state Health \\nService Areas and Health System Agencies: as result architects's client \\nmore likely be state agency than individual institution. \\nDespite these differences, and with variations of emphasis, structure of \\nhealth services in industrial countries essentially similar. Major elements: \\nAmbulant patient care: exemplified by group practice or medical \\noffice bldg, local or community clinics, health centres (HC), forming first \\ncontact between medical care and patient. \\nSmall hospitals: range from 10—15 beds (UK 'cottage hospitals') upto 100 beds, offering basic inpatient services. In UK most private hospitals \\nfall within this class. \\nCommunity hospitals (UK District General Hospitals (DGH)): medium- \\nsized to large with 200—600 inpatient beds and most or all major diagnostic and treatment specialties. Also provide some teaching for med, \\nnursing and para-med staff. Also provide specialist support for HC—4p1 81. \\nTertiary or teaching hospitals: usually have 600—1 000 beds, house \\nnot only all basic services but sophisticated specialties. Most provide \\nteaching for med students, nursing and para-med staff and post-graduate \\ntraining and research. \\nLong stay: for elderly, chronically sick, children, psychiatric patients \\nand some other special purposes p158 162—3 164. \\nIn relation to all these, continuing change of emphasis; general trend \\nnow shorter stay in hospitals, increase in specialist dept and services, \\ngreater stress on outpatient treatment and ambulant care, and development of such local services as health centres and clinics. \\nIn many developing countries pattern and order of priority different, with \\ngreater stress on provision of local units for essential preventive medicine \\ncampaigns and techniques. \\nBuilding regulations \\nWhereas in UK national bldg reg apply to new and upgraded health bldg in USA federal, state and local codes and standards must be consulted. \\nINFORMATION SOURCES \\nIn UK DHSS provides design information on specific areas, services \\nand eqp: published as Design Guides; Building Notes (HBN), Equipment \\nNotes (HEN) and Technical Memoranda (HTM); tendency now to pro- \\nvide more comprehensive and detailed information on Activity Data \\nSheets (ADB). Known as 'Red Pack', as yet incomplete, ADB sheets \\ncontained in 8 volumes divided into categories: 'A' describe activity \\nspace and list eqp required, together with appropriate physical and \\nenvironmental standards; 'B' contain diagrams of individual pieces of \\neqp. 'A' sheets offer choice: decision rests with planning team. Sheets \\nnot computerised, have to be collated manually. \\nOther material is available from such sources as King Edward VII Fund \\nfor Hospitals in London, Nuffield Foundation, and SHHD and Central \\nServices Agency (CSA); former Scottish Hospital Centre (SHC) \\nproduced small practical information sheets based on full-sized mock- \\nups of hospital rm. RHA, Welsh Technical Service and DHSS(NI) also \\nproduce guidance material. \\nIn USA broad range of material, less organised, available. Sources: \\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation (Princeton NJ), sponsors studies on \\nambulatory care; Assistant Secretary for Health, Dept of Health & \\nHuman Services (Washington DC) for enquiries on all aspects of health \\nservices planning; Kellog Foundation (Battle Creek Mich); American \\nHospital Association (Chicago Ill) has extensive reference services; \\nNational Technical Information Services (Springfield Va). \\nPLANNING & DESIGN \\nHospitals an amalgam of components, some simple, some extremely \\ncomplex: each has time scale which covers useful design life, ie before \\nit needs either major alterations or replacement. By careful planning and \\ndesign components with similar characteristics can be grouped together \\nso as to be adjacent to both those they serve and those with similar \\nstructural and service characteristics and life spans. \\nLarge or medium hospital complex includes not only patient accn and \\nmedical/technical installations but large admin section —p179—80, \\nelectro-mech plant and engineering services, laboratories and pharmacy \\n—p1 76 177, library p177, industrial installations for food services and \\nlaundry —p1 80, supply, service and disposal (sometimes in separate \\ncomplex), lecture halls, staff hostels and restaurants, car parks. \\nHospital essentially divided into 2 main units: inpatient care and outpatient \\ncare; further essential units; diagnosis and treatment, admin; frequent \\nadditional unit: education and research. In early planning relationship \\nbetween these significant; diagnosis and treatment appears as linking \\nfunction —(1)(2). Ideally these would all occur on 1 plane; however \\nmuch site and other organisational factors impose multi-storey design \\nease of lateral movement remains prime consideration. \\nBefore designer puts pen to paper brief must be prepared explaining \\noperational policies of hospital, with description of activities to be carried \\nout and resources required to do this efficiently. Successful design \\nrelies on effective and detailed brief: preparation must be joint venture \\nbetween hospital users and architect with his design team. \\n2 Hospital sectors diagram imposed on outline of New York USA Hospital: \\nd & t = diagnosis & treatment \\n1 Hospital sectors: diagram of relationships \\n\"),\n",

Main recent trend away \\nfrom classical ward types (eg 'Nightingale': 12-B open ward with nurses \\ndesk at 1 end; 'Rigs': 24-B with nursing rm outside ward, beds set in \\nclusters); preference now for 2—4 B. Despite this strong preference still \\ncontroversial: very small wards give privacy and in theory more personal \\nattention but can also be lonely, less often visited; ie society and staff \\nsupervision possibly better in larger ward. Patients need audio and \\nvisual privacy during med visits. Background noise and bed curtains \\nprovide some in large ward but lights disturb at night; small wards \\npeaceful for resting patient but do not provide audio-privacy. \\nIn USA most codes now give max 4-B/rm and design standards usually \\nfollowed maintain mix of 2-B and 1-B. In UK small rm also common; but \\nwards may consist of mix of different size rm —acute wards below. \\nAv stay in hospital for acute med or surgery has fallen, eg: major surgery \\n10—12 days, minor 2—3 days, max 6 weeks (mainly orthopedic). Wards \\nfor these purposes therefore designed for max efficiency of staff working. \\nFor physically and mentally handicapped and elderly — 'long stay' — ward \\ndesign more domestic and social —pl 58 162 163. \\nKey problem of design for efficient ward system: relationship of nurse \\nworking rm to patientrm. Basic concept —3(1). \\nWARD DESIGN: ACUTE \\nAcute wards contain 24—30 beds; where possible should be linked \\ntogether to form admin unit of 2 or 4 wards, which also enables such \\nservice as day areas, doctors rm, disposal rm, sto etc be shared between \\n2 wards; but check against fire reg before design decision made. \\nPossible breakdown of bed areas for 28-bed mixed sex wards include: \\n3 x 8-B rm + 4 x 1-B rm \\n4 x 6-B rm + 4 x 1-B rm \\n2x 12-Brm+4x 1-Brm \\nMost acute med and surgical wards can be mixed-sex, argument being \\nthat it increases bed occupancy. 1-B wards needed maintain occupancy \\nat max of 85% or above: 1-B also required for patients liable to infection, \\nor to infect others, those seriously ill or dying and those likely to disturb \\nothers. Mixed-sex ward may not be acceptable to all users: check \\nbefore designing on this basis. \\nWalking distance: keep walking distances short as possible for nurses \\nand ambulant patient. Max distance from bed to wc 12 m and from nurse \\nworking rm to furthest bed approx 20 m. \\nObservation: continuous observation of patient by staff essential part \\nof nursing care: during day achieved mainly in course of walking from 1 \\nduty to another, at night from nurses station. Good design aim: 50% of \\nbeds to be visible from nurses station. Patients gain confidence from \\nseeing staff at work, dead-leg wards not popular for this reason; if staff \\nhave no duty perform less likely visit ward. \\nControl: patients, particularly children, adolescents and confused, need \\nto be controlled; dayr must not be too isolated from rest of ward. \\nMixed-sex wards have own control problems. Staff need to control \\nvisitors and check that they do not overtire patients. \\nNoise: problem in large open areas; telephones and other el and mech \\neqp can be noisier than acceptable. Design for 40—45 dB by day and \\n35—40 dB at night in multi-B wards; 1-B wards should be 35—40 dB at all \\ntimes. Courtyard designs can create problems of noise from adjacent \\nwindows to different rm. \\nDaylight & glare windows —p4O3—6 should not cause glare —p32 398 \\nin bedfast patients' eyes; beds should be parallel to windows unless \\nbrise-soleil, external or between-glass blinds or similar devices fitted. \\nWindows design important: confused patients may try get out; all opening \\nlights should have device restricting accessible opening to 100. \\nVentilation: mech ventilation often noisy and unsatisfactory, full air- \\nconditioning expensive install and run. Normal sites away from air or \\ntraffic noise should rely on natural ventilation; 3 beds deep from window \\nmax before mech ventilation required. Central work rm require mech \\nventilation and suffer from heat build-up in summer. \\nNurse call systems, closed circuit television (CCTV): Devices of \\nvarious grades of sophistication; all liable to abuse or failure. Seriously ill \\npatients cannot operate call systems therefore unwise rely on these \\nrather than personal observation; acceptable as auxiliary system. \\n1-Brm \\nmulti-B bay (per B) \\ndayr (per B) \\nlockers etc (per B) \\nnurse station \\nclean utility \\ndirty utility & sluice \\ntreatment rm \\nassisted bathr \\nsisters rm \\ndoctors rm \\nbathr \\nwashing & sho \\ncompartment \\nwc with hand rinse \\nbasin \\nptr \\nward k \\nflower bay \\ncleaner \\nsto (inc large eqp) \\ninterview rm & \\novernight stay \\ncirculation ar \\nlOOm2 \\n9.3—1 0.0 m2 \\n0.75 m2 \\n0.5—1.0 m2 \\n4.0—10.0 m2 \\n10.2—18.0 m2 \\n14.0—16.0 m2 \\n14.0—1 6.0 m2 \\n10.25—12.0 m2 \\n7.0—9.0 m2 \\n7.0—9.0 m2 \\n7.0m2 \\n2.75 m2 \\n2.0—3.0 m2 \\n4.0—6.0 m2 \\n20.0 m2 \\n2.0—2.5 m2 \\n5.0—8.0 m2 \\n12.0—20.0 m2 \\n10.0—12.0 m2 \\n25%—40% \\nexcluding wc & sho \\ndepending on amount of \\nday space provided in \\nwards or as separate day \\nspace: separate 10.0 m2 \\nextra space for lockers \\netc \\ndepending on position \\nof drug, linen bays etc \\nif separate ar = 9 m + \\n7 m \\ndepending on sto \\nprovided \\nfor ambulant patients \\nmm for ambulant P \\nmax for wheelchair P \\nbeverage & snack point \\nonly \\nfor ward k service \\nACUTE WARD: SUGGESTED AREAS \\nI ® \\nr \\n• option I \\nnursing : \\nB \\n• sub-station • I_ \\nA control access & egress to unit \\nB access&visualobsefvationtoP \\nC Convenient access to support activities \\n1 Diagram of nursing/P rm relationship \\nmay be shared with \\nanother ward \\ndepends on ward layout \\n\"),\n",

Community involve- \\nment often encouraged in USA both by making appropriate parts of \\ncentre available to public, eg gymnasium, children's play rm or craft \\nstudio, and by incorporating such amenities as art gallery or public lib. \\nAssociation with med centre desirable but important psychologically \\npsychiatric centre maintain own identity and character. Environment \\ncontributes essentially to therapeutic process. Centre should be non- \\ninstitutional as possible consistent with type of patient, need for security, \\nprotection from self-injury and vandalism; range from 'open door' to \\nforensic institution for criminally insane. \\nGreat size to be avoided; patients should be grouped into units (max \\n30 P), small enough facilitate development of community spirit (atmos- \\nphere nearer college dormitory than hospital). \\nWhere climate allows common practice provide residential units in form \\nof cottages in landscaped grounds. Even where restricted site imposes \\ncompact bldg form essential individual units be identifiable as separate entities. \\nBedr should afford opportunity retreat and privacy: if 2-B, plan so that \\neach patient has clearly defined individual area. \\nConversely design and furnishing of public areas should encourage \\nsociability, supplementing formal treatment with therapeutically beneficial, \\ninformal patient/patient and patient/staff meetings. Place nurse/security \\nstations so that staff engaged in routine activities can observe patients \\ncasually. Unobstructive nature of such surveillance important psycho- \\nlogically in alleviating persecution complex. \\nHierarchical arrangement of staff and patients in group therapy rm \\ninhibits patient involvement. Square or circular seating space affording \\nmm distraction, with circular seating arrangement, probably ideal. \\nMentally disturbed persons commonly show symptoms disorientation \\nwith regard to time and space.

Must be provided for outpatients \\nand inpatients both for routine examinations and for emergencies. Dept \\ntherefore has relationship to OPD, medical, intensive care and surgical \\nunits. \\nSeparation of inpatient, typically on trolley, stretcher or wheelchair, from \\noutpatient in street clothes and often bloody, should be maintained long \\nas possible, certainly through entrance, reception and waiting: if dept \\nlarge enough also through radiographic procedure and exit. \\nArrange x-ray procedure rm so that patient's travel path does not cross \\nthat of radiology technician until they meet in procedure rm. Easy \\ntrolley/stretcher access to x-ray table essential. Plan dept so that technician \\ntravel time kept mm particularly between rm and film processing. \\nSimple x-rays to locate fractures or position of catheter take less than 10 \\nminutes; more complex or intermittent procedures involving barium \\nswallows or radio-opaque injections may take up to 3 hr to complete \\nwhile patient waits in or near dept. Design for following requirements: \\nseparate rm for ultrasonography and for thermography; bench with \\ndrinking water, bottle-trapped sink with sto cpd over exclusively for \\nbarium preparations and wc for patients who have had barium enemas \\nboth next to 2 x-ray rm; rm and viewing bay to process and check \\naccuracy of films (normally completed within 15 minutes of being taken): \\nautomatic plumbed-in processors need special drainage; forward wait- \\ning area on basis of 1.3 m2/P plus 1.02 for relative or escort; extra \\nscreened space for 2 patients' trolleys; 2 wc suitable for patient in \\nwheelchairs —+pl 67(6). \\nEach x-ray rm must be screened from other parts of bldg either by \\nbarium plaster or by lead sheeting, both very dense heavy materials. All \\nglazing should be in lead glass. X-ray eqp heavy and requires ceiling \\nheights between 3100 and 4000, extra moveable structural beams \\nsuspended from ceiling will be required.

Unlike traditional suite with different rm for different \\nservices (eg, ENT, orthopedic) suites now collection of multi-purpose \\nrm. In large institutions more than 1 suite likely be provided, based on \\nusage: short (1—3 hr) procedures, such as ambulatory, frequently \\nseparated from general, av length (2—4 hr) and very long (6—8 hr) \\nprocedures. Delivery suites, formerly completely separated from surgical, \\ntoday commonly alongside or integrated. \\nDesign elements \\nConsider patient flow: entrance, control, holding pre-anaesthesia, \\noperating, recovery. Consider staff: control, clean-up. Consider eqp, \\nparticularly instruments and other goods which must be sterilised between \\neach use: done locally (within suite) or centrally (for hospital)? Let \\nvolumes guide. Consider sharing: like types of procedure rm can share \\nsupplies, cleaning etc. Consider testing functions: 'quick' lab tests, \\nx-ray etc: how will they be done? \\nSpace needs \\nSpace suites need per inpatient bed varies greatly, depending on \\nwhether ambulatory surgery offered, whether hospital has teaching \\nprogramme and other such factors: generally 28—46 m2 for each operating \\ntheatre. Space for circulation, nursing and medical staff and non-functional \\nbldg elements such as air-conditioning eqp usually high ratio in this \\nsetting, perhaps 80% above individual rm needs. If reprocessing goods \\ndone within suite 28—37 m2/operating theatre or delivery rm must be \\nadded. Locker rm, showers and rest rm for staff should be provided based on number staff expected. \\nCirculation \\nCrucial to design of high technology operating and delivery suites; 2 \\nbasic types: single corridor and double corridor or 'racetrack'. Single has 1 corridor leading to all operating/delivery rm, used for patients, staff and eqp: sterility maintained in each user of corridor and within \\ntheatre itself; each rm preceded by scrub-up ar and has provision for \\nsterilisation within it or between 2 rm. 'Racetrack' arranges rm in 'circular' \\nfashion with outside corridor or rm for staff and eqp, presumed sterile; \\nlocker rm 'bridge' corridors; staff and eqp leave with patient; staff \\n'bridged' back through locker rm and showers. Corridor for P trolleys 2: \\n45mw; others 1.5mw. \\nCleanliness \\nAlso critical in operating/delivery suite. All materials, surfaces, joints etc \\nmust be easily cleanable and durable for repeated washings: sealed \\njoints to prevent infection. Anti-static materials should be used where \\npatients likely be connected anaesthetic machines.

In USA 'free-standing' \\nambulatory units fall into several categories, in addition to physician's \\noffice, generally with twofold aim providing preventative medicine and \\nmaking available health care at lower cost than involved in full hospital \\ntreatment. Each such unit starts with programme worked out meet \\nmarket needs within service area, community or region. Various types \\nunit include Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), founded some \\n40 years ago as alternative insurance programme for industrial workers, \\nprimary care centres in rural areas tor emergency exam and treatment \\n(include pre-hospital beds), community health and social centres usually \\nfounded by local or regional government. Each of these may contain \\nsome, all or more services than UK HC. Larger ones often attached \\nhospitals. \\nHC primary activities: consult, exam and minor treatment backed by \\nmed records, reception, waiting and sto areas. Basic amenities must \\ninclude: pram and car parking, wc for patients and staff, changing areas, \\nrest rm with kitchenette for staff. \\nSecondary activities for large HC may include diagnostic and treatment \\nservices — physiotherapy, chiropody, dentistry, radio diagnosis and \\npharmacy — and health clinics for education and assessment, off for \\nhealth visitors, domiciliary nurses, social workers etc. \\nViable size for HC consulting resources for not less than 6 GP, but as \\nvital to place HO near population served may be smaller and less well \\nequipped in rural areas. \\nOn basis 1 GP has approx 2500 patients, centre for 6 GP will serve \\npopulation of 15000 and for 12 GP 30000.

Reformed order of service depends on \\nwhether \\'high\\', \\'low\\' or \\'free\\'. Some likeness between forms of Roman \\nCatholic, High Anglican and High Presbyterian (Scotland and USA). \\nFree follow Calvinist and Lutheran origins with emphasis on preaching \\nand communion carried out round \\'Lord\\'s Table\\', usually centrally placed \\nwith nearby pulpit either behind table or to left hand side. Baptists need \\nlarge heated water tank usually under removable floor for inititiation by \\ntotal immersion. Fonts used almost universally for initiation into main \\ngroups and dedication into others. Many newer religious sects have \\nidiosyncratic requirements related to special forms and musical per- \\nformances. In USA Protestant churches have approx 70 million members, \\nRoman Catholic 50 million, Orthodox 4 million. \\nChurches throughout world now have strong community concern; \\nplanning often relates to weekday uses; keyword flexibility. Ancillary \\naccn, according to programme, may incorporate, eg coffee rrn, coun- \\nselling rm, meeting rm, radio station. Car parking must be taken into \\naccount. Centralised plan popular; but ritualistic, processional and oblong \\nforms also used. However, importance of priest, pastor or leader should \\nnot be lost; liturgical functions carried out by individual churches of great \\nimportance in design. \\nMore recently new factors have emerged, among them security of \\nchurch property, adequate acoustic design (for music and voice) and \\nprovision for disabled. \\nha for \\norchestra \\nvestry sacnsty \\npulpit \\nha for altar communicant \\nsarcophagus \\ncelebrant\\'s \\nchair high altar \\nsacristyflC communion \\ndom \\nCflOi,tl side altar \\ni_tp1p1t I \\nbaptistryIf\\' \\n& \\nchoir \\ntowers \\n4N \\nt \\n1 Design for Berliner Dom \\n(Lutheran) Germany Arch Schinkel \\n2 Typical Roman Catholic church \\nlayout \\nentrance font lady chapel \\n—i high \\nwith \\nlantern \\nover \\npressionaI door \\nsacristy communicants \\nwc \\ntar \\npul font \\nhigh \\naltar sacristy \\nside \\ncongregationa \\nchapel \\nerPU2 \\n9 \\n5 Circular Protestant church \\nEssen Germany Arch 0 Bartning \\n10 Orthodox church of St Sava McKeesport USA Arch Pekruhn \\n7 Corpus Chnsti (Roman Catholic) \\nchurch Aachen Germany \\nArch A Schwarz \\n8 Church & parish ha (Reformed) \\n1-lanweiler Germany \\nArch R Kruger \\n\"-i\\' ¶ii \\n2 \\nllI—i11 --4— - ---F — --f- \\n11 St Michael Hatfield Hyde (Anglican) Welwyn Garden City England Arch \\nClarke Hall Scorer & Bright \\nkey 1 entrance 2 chapel 3 vestly 4 pulpit & lectern 5 baptistry 6 altar with \\nbaldachino \\n'),\n",

However, mosques vary \\nextensivey throughout Islam from square village hall types to great \\nhistorical examples in Egypt, Syria, Spain, Iran, Turkey and India. Few \\npurpose built examples in W: many sects, with varying needs, adapt or \\nrent existing bldg for Friday prayers and for the two id celebrations, for \\nIslamic new year and end of Ramadan. \\n3 main types of traditional mosque: early open plan, usually to be found \\nin desert regions; central court, patterned after Mohammed's house at \\nMedina; open court, with 4 vaulted halls (iwans) 1 on each side of court. \\nMosque bldg have followed climatic needs for shade through use of \\narcades, colonnades and courtyards incorporating areas of water — \\nmost important for ablutions but also for cooling. These elements often \\nused symbolically in designs and heavily ornamented or planned as \\nlandscape features round mosques. Main architectural feature mihrab \\nbasic to all mosques: set in wall facing Mecca (k/b/a wall), often emphasised \\nby windows or by dome above. Monumental grandeur of mosque came \\nlargely through need to enclose activities in harsher northern climates \\nbut also related to advances in vault construction in 11th and 12th \\ncenturies AD; thus domed mihrab area was enlarged by single vault \\nprayer hall or 4 vault iwans or //wans arranged symmetrically around \\ncourt.

After introduction of loudspeakers little used for calling. \\nTypes vary from none to cylindrical needle minarets in glazed tile with 1 \\nhigh gallery, common in Iran; type with 2—3 galleries capped with wood \\ncones and based on polygonal plan in Turkey; often 2—6 minarets per \\nmosque in some countries, depending on size. \\nSegregation \\nMale worshippers only in most mosques although gallery for women \\noften found.

Rapid \\nchanges in technology create new fields of study and demand costly \\nsophisticated eqp which must be fully used: consequent need for \\nadaptable lab spaces which may be changed during life of bldg. \\nMost difficulties in adapting to change arise because lab benches, sto \\ncupboards and piped services as permanent fixtures can only be moved \\nwith considerable effort and disruption. 1 approach is design main \\nstructure and standard services as fixed items with more specific variable \\nitems, including furniture, movable. \\nPLANNING PRINCIPLES \\nMost significant recent developments in planning: \\nadoption of square rather than rectangular modules —÷(1) allowing for \\ngreater flexibility in bench arrangements with introduction of island \\nbench units and free standing eqp; \\nuse of movable table tops rather than permanent fixed bench units: \\nvariations in work top height as well as grouping of tables can be \\nachieved to suit particular needs; \\narrangement of heavy eqp, fume cupboards, wash-up etc grouped in \\ncentral service zones. \\nINDIVIDUAL SPACE REQUIREMENTS —*(2)(3) \\nIdeally conditioned by critical anthropometric dimensions, eg depth of \\nwork top being based on max convenient reach; may be some 600 in \\ntheory but in practice work top may vary between 610 and 840. Work top \\nlength similarly may vary between 2100 and 4600 for research student, \\ndepending on discipline and particular research requirements; can be \\nreduced to approx 1 500/P where groups of workers share eqp. Work \\ntop height may vary between low chemistry benches at 450 above flocr \\nlevel and 900 for benches at which worker stands. \\nPLANNING MODULE \\nWorking unit (group of work places) forms basic planning bay or module \\n—(2b). Normal work place can be considered as being approx 1600 x \\n800. Module width may vary from 2600 to 5250; av approx 3000 to \\n3600, which allows 2 parallel rows of benches with centre gangway \\ngiving room to pass between 2 workers. \\nModule w = 2 work spaces + centre passageway \\n3000—3 600 2 x 800 1400—2000 \\nTypical bldg dimensions include: \\nmodulew 3000—3600 \\nmodule d 5000—8 000 \\ncorrw 2000—2500 \\nstorey h 3600—4 200 \\n________ link to adjoining unit \\n&/or fire escape \\naM bE2] \\nIL] dE2i \\neH ii \\nip 15 20m \\nI I I 16 32 48 64 ft \\n\"),\n",

Vertical ducts can be integrated with main structural frame, \\nprovide ready access to services on floor they serve, eliminate problem \\nof fume cupboard ducting; but can prove expensive structurally if service \\npotential not fully utilised. Horizontal distribution of sub-mains \\nusually cheaper initially; but has not same adaptability and requires \\nnumerous connexions in floor. \\nSeveral methods of servicing individual benches available; need for \\nadaptability led to development of movable and pre-plumbed services \\nconnected flexibly to floor points. Central service spine permits back- \\nto-back layout of benches; service bollard allows benching laid out in 2 \\ndirections. However, studies of relocatable spine systems show new \\nlayout often involves extra cost and disrupts activities in rm below since \\nlive supply of services to all possible connexion points prohibitively \\nexpensive. \\nOverhead servicing by mast and/or flexibles more convenient and \\neconomic arrangement. Perimeter, peninsular and island layouts can be \\nserviced in any combination and spacing required. Access for main- \\n1 Flexible lab ar of science block \\nWellesley College Massachusetts \\nUSA Arch Perry Dean Stahl Rogers \\ntenance and adaptation can be achieved with mm disruption of furniture \\nand eqp layouts and confined to floor being served. Valuable floor space \\ncan be saved since traditional floor-mounted service spine between \\nbenches removed. Furthermore, tendency overprovide to compensate \\nfor lack of flexibility in layout reduced. \\nDISPOSAL SYSTEMS \\nDrainage problem with overhead servicing: gravity rather than pumped \\nor vacuum-assisted systems simplest, with permanent grid of floor \\npoints. Lab wastes may carry corrosive agents or be of very high temp. \\nDrip cups, bottle traps in borosilicate glass and chemically resistant ptfe \\nflexible tubing to outlets normal methods of dealing with such require- \\nments. In any case waste runs should be immediately visible and \\naccessible in rm to which they belong. \\nSolid waste normally put in bins; but in hospital research or animal \\nexperiment lab incineration of soiled material or carcasses obligatory. \\nSTORAGE \\nGrowth in project work and use of multi-discipline lab has increased \\namount and type of sf0. Recent developments toward adjustable shelving \\nand trays: movable sto units under tables more adaptable than fixed \\nbench sto. \\nPressing need for further space makes organisation and management \\nof sto major consideration. Categories include: \\ncentral: special sf0 often centralised (eg workshop sto, inflammable \\nsolvents, explosives, poisons); best for large scale and/or expensive \\neqp; staff organisation and checking control important; \\nlocal: frequent use of items necessitates regular local sto, limited in \\ncapacity; \\nwork place: essential for personal eqp and project work material. \\nkey \\nh hot water \\ncoid water \\nm main \\nW waste \\ng gas \\ntwp rain water \\nwvp waste vent pipe \\nte telephone & at \\nle iume extract \\nI lighting trunking \\nheating pipes \\nas air suppiy \\n2 3 Zoology dept Edinburgh University Scotland: left integration of services and structure \\nright section through dept extension showing repetitive vertical sub-mains ducting \\niFmn - wUP . \\nLjL oljHlL \\nworktop sto cpd \\no \\n4 Overhead flexible servicing in pilot project \\nLeicester Polytechnic England Arch Leicester \\nEducation Authority \\n400 \\n400 \\n5 Section through sciences lab Polytechnic Sunderland England showing details of overhead \\nservicing & its integration within structure Arch Jo4in S Bonnington Partnership \\n'),\n",

This knowledge helps him \\nassess how manufactured products specified \\nand constructions designed perform in use. \\nPrecise values influenced by such factors as \\ntemp, moisture content, surface condition, \\ninternal structure. These usually determined \\nby means of standard tests, which may take \\ninto account conditions of use. Handbooks \\nissued by professional and other independent \\norganisations give precise values for many \\ncommon materials, with details on conditions \\nunder which values were determined. Manu- \\nfacturers\\' literature may also give values. \\n—.( 1) brings together values from many sources: \\ndevised as aid for architects at early stages of \\ndesign. In most instances range of values given. \\nDesigner must judge which appropriate to his \\nneed. However, in some instances contractual \\nor regulatory reasons may impose standardised \\nvalues, or values determined by standard tests. \\nManufactured products may be combinations \\nof different materials, chosen and placed to \\ngive desired performance. Innumerable com- \\nbinations available, some proprietary. Not \\npossible give their values here.

System starts at point \\nof entry of service to bldg or from boiler and plant rm to all spaces being \\nserved. Points of entry of services and plant rm location should be \\ndetermined at early stage. \\nDISTRIBUTION MEDIUM \\nHeating distribution may be by hot water, steam, or warm air. Water may \\nbe at low pressure under boiling point or at high pressure above boiling \\npoint depending on quantity of heat to be distributed. Air inefficient \\nmeans of distribution but required for ventilation or air conditioning. \\nExample: in 100 tube transfer capacities are: \\nlow velocity air 072 kW \\nhigh velocity air 2.16 kW \\nlow pressure hot water 525 kW \\nhigh pressure hot water 2385 kW \\nDISTRIBUTION LAYOUTS \\nIn multi-storey bldg distribution pattern may be: \\n(a) primarily horizontal with secondary distribution up or down through \\nfloors; \\n(b) primarily vertical with secondary distribution along floors. \\n(a) more common especially for low bldg or those with dissimilar flow \\nplans but system may occupy greater building volume by increasing \\nfloor to tloor height of all floors. \\n(b) more suitable for high bldg with repetitive floor plans. \\nPRIMARY HORIZONTAL DISTRIBUTION \\nWhether primary distribution at ground level or root level will depend on \\nlocation of boiler or plant rm At ground level may be in walkways or \\ncrawlways under ground slab provided these do not conflict with foun- \\ndations. \\nAt roof level distribution may be in pitched root void or in extra deep \\nceiling void. Horizontal distribution above root level difficult protect from \\nweather, complicates root drainage. \\nPRIMARY VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION \\nPrimary vertical distribution is by vertical duct spaces through bldg. \\nDirection of horizontal connexion at floor slab level should not be limited \\nby adjacent stairwells, lift shafts, or flues. Trimming beams may also limit \\nhorizontal connexions. \\nINTERCONNEXION VERTICAL & HORIZONTAL \\nInterconnexion between vertical and horizontal duct critical: ducts should \\nnot be in same vertical plane and vertical duct should be long side onto \\nhorizontal duct to give greatest common interconnecting area. \\nACCESS TO DUCTS \\nAccess to ducts should be adequate for maintenance work and for \\nrenewal of pipes etc, which have shorter life than that of bldg. Access \\neither through duct — walkways, crawlways and large vertical ducts — or \\nthrough access panels in side or top of duct. \\nFIRE PRECAUTIONS \\nEither firestops at floor level or fr construction and access panels. \\nSOUND TRANSMISSION \\nFloor construction carried through at or near floor level. All pipe pen- \\netrations sealed airtight. Access panels of adequate sound reduction \\nand sealed airtight. \\nVENTILATION \\nSome ducts may require ventilation to limit temp rise or because of \\nservice contained, eq natural gas. Where floor construction carried \\nthrough, vent each floor top and bottom. If duct continuous, vent at ends \\n(—. Bib 111). \\nWALKWAYS —+(1 )(2) \\nRetain clear working space 700 wide x 2000 high after all services \\ninstalled. Large takeoffs and expansion loops may require additional \\nwidth. Access from ends — boiler rm or plant rm.

Surface preferably floor for low temp gradient \\nbut wall or ceiling surfaces can be used. \\nFloor surface temp limited to 29°C. \\nEmission: 50% radiation 50% convection. \\nMedium temp radiant panels: flat steel or cast iron plates with water- \\nways cast in or welded to back of plate. Surface temp generally 75°C. \\nEmission: 50% radiation 50% convection. \\nRadiators: generally made from sheet steel; may be 1, 2 or 3 panel or \\nwith fins on back to increase output for given face area. Surface temp \\n75°C. \\nRadiant: convection emission depends on number of panels, fins etc; \\nsingle panel approx 25% radiation 75% convection. \\nIf radiators in corner or recess allow space for valves and for air flow \\nNatural convectors: may be continuous casing or individual casing of \\npressed steel containing finned tube heater. Heat output depends on \\nsize of finned tube and height of convector. \\nSurface temp lower than radiator: about 35°C. Safer with young children \\nor disabled people. \\nEmission: 10% radiation 90% convection. \\nNatural convector cases often made of builders work for better appear- \\nance and robustness —(3). Opening at bottom A should not be less than \\nwidth of finned tube. Inside depth of casing B should only allow mm \\nclearance (6) for finned tube. Grille at top should have at least 70% open \\narea. \\nFan convectors: similar to natural convectors except that air circulation \\nby fan. High output for small size and independent of height of casing. \\nHeat output easily controlled by fan speed. May be positioned overhead \\nif fan adequate to blow hot air down. \\nEmission: 100% convection. \\nDucted warm air: for heating similar to fan convectors.

Sounds of equal level in dB but at different \\nfrequencies (frequency roughly equivalent to pitch) not equally loud: \\nalways necessary make frequency analysis of sound; 'overall' levels or \\nsingle figure measurements not related frequency little use. \\nSOUND REDUCTION INDEX (SRI) \\nMeasure of sound insulation against airborne sound: difference in noise \\nlevels between 2 spaces separated by wall or floor corrected for \\nacoustical conditions in quiet rm. Conversely, subtracting SRI of 1 \\nelement from noise level in 1 rm gives after correction noise level to be \\nexpected in second rm caused by sound transmitted by that element. \\nSRI = L, — [2 — log S/A where L1 and [2 are noise levels in rm 1 & 2, \\nS is partition area, A is total sound absorption in rm 2 \\nSRI depends on weight and will vary with frequency. Values for 1-leaf \\nhomogeneous solid partitions can be calculated —.(1). \\nMethod of calculation: \\nenter figure at surface weight of panel and draw horizontal line in lower \\npart of figure \\ndraw vertical lines through intersections of this line with frequency scale \\ninto upper part of figure \\nread off SRI at intersections with graph for appropriate material: lower \\nparts of graph identical for panels of same weight; graphs change from \\ninitial slope to flat 'plateau' at points indicated for each material \\nExample: \\nSRI of 100 conqrete: surface weight = 230 kg/m2 \\nfrequency Hz 3 125 250 500 1000 2000 4000 8000 \\nSRIdb 37 38 38 46 56 62 68 74 \\nFor more complex structures SRI can be estimated —p396(1). \\nFrom —.(1) can be seen that weight of partition must be doubled to \\nincrease SRI by 6dB below plateau regions.

Specially contoured \\nplastics metallised louvre grids concentrate light downwards with low \\nbrightness appearance of ceiling. \\nIn air-conditioned bldg extract air should be drawn through 'air- \\nhandling' luminaires so that heat can be removed from lamps and \\ncontrol gear before enters rm. This heat may often be uselully recovered \\nfor use in perimeter areas. \\nGlare \\nExcessive brightness contrast in field of view can cause glare —.pl 732. If \\nsource, eg window or unshaded desk lamp, seen close to visual task it \\ncan cause disability glare and reduce task visibility; can also be cause of \\ndiscomfort; this can occur even when source is well away from task, eg \\nluminaires on ceiling, and is much more common danger. IES code \\ngives recommendations for upper limit of discomfort glare index, which \\nis related to luminance and size of light sources, their number and \\nposition in field of view and luminance of their surroundings. Calculation \\nof this glare index can be performed as described —.Bib382. \\nContrast \\nObjects are seen by contrast, either contained contrast or contrast with \\ntheir background: higher the contrast the more visible the object. Visi- \\nbility of printed or written matter depends on contrast of marking material \\nwith paper. This can be markedly dependent on lighting and viewing \\nangles even if materials used not obviously glossy. Light sources should \\nbe kept out of 'forbidden zone' indicated —(4): best position is to one \\nside of worker rather than in front. \\nUniformity \\nVariation of illuminance over working area should not normally be such \\nthat mm is less than 0.8 of av. To ensure this manufacturer's rec- \\nommended spacing/h ratio (ratio of horizontal distance apart, 5, to \\nmounting height above working plane, H) should not be exceeded. \\n2 \\n\"),\n",

Standard life 1 000 hr and 'efficacy', \\nte efficiency of light production, varies from 10—18 lumens per watt \\n(lm/W); some manufacturers offer lamp lasting 2000 hr for use where \\nconcomitant drop in light output can be accepted as price of less \\nfrequent maintenance. \\nLamps with bulbs silvered for use as integral spotlight or floodlight \\navailable; but better optical control and higher efficacy obtainable from \\ntungsten lamps with small quartz bulbs and halogen gas filling \\nFluorescent lamps suitable for concealed lighting in home —.(3)(4), for \\nkitchen lighting and for most industrial and commercial interiors of \\nmoderate ceiling height.

When side-lit rm deep enough for work requiring illumi- \\nnance 500 lx to be carried out at distance from window greater than \\nheight of window head above working plane, el light required for more \\nthan 15% of working year as DF will probably be less than 10% —+p27—30. \\nThis requirement increases to about 50%, at depth of 1 1/2_2 window \\nhead height and to practically 1 00%, even with fully glazed wall, if depth \\ngreater than 5 x that height. If tinted glazing used these depths greatly \\nreduced. \\nTherefore arrange general lighting luminaires in rows parallel to window \\nwall, each row switched separately. Switches should be located so that \\nthey can be conveniently operated by occupants as required and so that it \\nis clear which rows they operate. Often possible provide pendant switches \\ncontrolling individual luminaires with thin light cords which can be \\nreached from standing position. \\nFluorescent lamps should be chosen from 'intermediate' colour range \\n—.p25(3) compatible with colour rendering requirements and with warmth \\nof lighting required at night. El lighting should be designed to provide \\nilluminance recommended for particular tasks carried out in interior, but \\nnot less than 30 lx on av over working plane. \\nLi \\n1 Daytime control of luminaures in relation to depth of interior space \\nFor max conservation of energy automatic control should be installed in \\nnew bldg to switch off, or preferably dim, those rows of luminaires \\nlighting the working area (usually first 2 or 3) which are not required \\nwhen daylight rises to provide illuminance at that depth such that full el \\nlighting not necessary—(1). \\nUnder these conditions windows need not be designed to achieve max \\npenetration of daylight; more attention can be paid to any requirements \\nfor obtaining max benefit from exterior view, eg by providing wide \\nuninterrupted windows rather than high and narrow ones. Opportunity \\ncan be taken to reduce contrast of wall above or between windows with \\nexterior seen through them by maintaining light colour and arranging for \\nsome wall washing by artificial lighting. \\nIn top-lit interiors with sufficient glazing to provide an average DF of \\n10% over working area el lighting will similarly be required for 15% of \\nworking year for tasks on which 500 lx required, and for longer than this \\nwhere higher illuminance required or lower OF provided. If there is \\ndifference between activities carried out in different areas, requiring \\ndifferent Iluminances or different periods of occupation, el lighting may \\nbe switched by areas. Otherwise whole installation can be linked to 1 \\ncontroller. This may be photo-electric switch or photo-electric dimming \\ncontrol where fluorescent lighting is used; but at the date of writing there \\nis little experience of application of such control to other types of \\ndischarge lamps. \\nLighting references. \\n—.Bibliography entries 112 124202271 367380381 382 383 384 385 386 \\n387 397 449 457 523 \\nO.Bh \\nwall-washer \\n1.6h \\nrarely needed: \\nuse automatic \\nswitching \\n1.6h \\nproportion frequently \\nneeded; use automatic \\ndimming top-up control \\n1 .6 h -J \\nhigh proportion frequently \\nneeded: use automatic \\ndimming top-up control \\nalways needed: \\nkeep switched on \\nwhile interior occupied \\nO.Sh h \\nwp \\nI I \\n2h 3h 4h \\ndistance from window \\n5h 6h \\n\"),\n",

For some cases directions of swing of double doors specified in \\nreg. \\nMeans of escape from fire covered in Section II of Part E of Bldg reg: contains no detail on doorways but refers to code of practice. CP3: \\nChapter IV. Part 1: 1971 (Flats and maisonettes in blocks over two \\nstoreys) contains recommendations on main entrance doors to dwellings \\nand on type and location of internal doors to bedr, living rm and kitchens. \\nSection 4.3 lists requirements of frdoors. Part 2: 1968 (Shops and dept \\nstores) gives dimensions for exit openIngs: 1 070 for up to 200 users \\nwith additional 152 for each 30 persons over 200. Number of persons \\nfound by dividing total occupants of floor by number 1 less than number \\nof exits. Part 3: 1968 (Office buildings) gives requirement of mm opening width of exit doors in multi-staircase bldg as 765 for doorway serving up to 230 m2 gross floor area, 1 070 up to 1 860 m2 plus an additional 76 for \\neach additional 140 m2 served. \\nIn general all doors which are fire escapes must open in direction of \\nescape; doors which open into corridor must not cause obstruction \\nwithin corridor; width of final exit doorway must not be less than mm \\nwidth of stairs, corridors or lobbies which it serves. Exit doors must be \\nlabelled; in certain instances sign must have emergency illumination. \\nFLOW CAPACITY \\nWhere pedestrian traffic heavy rate at which people move through \\ndoorway determined by type of people (old/young, whether carrying \\nbaggage etc) and by degree of congestion on each side of doorway. \\nTotal rate at which people can move through doorway in both directions \\nfar less than capacity with flow in 1 direction only; for heavy 2-way traffic, \\n2 separate openings should be provided —(3). \\n3 Capacity of doorways with unidirectional pedestrian flow \\nDISABLED PERSONS \\nStandard door sizes: mm convenient width for ambulant disabled 800 \\ndoorset (opening width 675, infernal door).

Doorswings should not conflict with each other and \\nshould not extend over steps. \\nSelf-closing doors can cause difficulty to disabled; if essential, action \\nshould be as light as possible.

Bldg reg H3 gives \\nrequirement that going and twice rise should add up to between 550 and \\n700. \\nOther criteria of stair proportions: energy expenditure and freedom from \\naccidents. Total amount of energy used can become smaller as stairs \\nincrease in steepness but rate of energy expenditure increases. More \\naccidents occur in descending than in climbing stairs; number of mis- \\nsteps increases as size of tread reduced. Generally satisfactory \\nproportions can vary from 100 rise and 360 going to 180 rise and 280 \\ngoing. Private stairs in dwellings may be satisfactory up to steepness of \\n210 rise and 240 going. \\nWALKING SPEEDS & FLOW CAPACITY \\nShort flights of stairs rarely climbed at speed which minimises energy \\nexpenditure (as people tend to do when walking on level) but av walking \\nspeeds on stairs lower than in corridors. When alone most people walk \\nfaster downwards than upwards but in dense crowd reverse can be true. \\nFor fire safety codes flow capacity of 1 .3 P/s/m width has often been \\nused as basis of recommendations but this is greater than normally \\nacceptable in general use —.(2). \\nfree ftow: mean plan \\ndensity 0.6 P/rn2 \\nor less \\nfull design capacity \\n1-way flow: plan \\ndensity 2 P/rn2 \\nspeed limit ot \\nalong stair \\nSlope capacity \\n(mis) with free \\nflow lP/ \\nminim w) \\nspeed stair \\nalong capacity \\nslope (P/min/ \\n(m/s) m w) \\nyoung & middle-aged \\nmen \\nyoung & middle-aged \\nwomen \\nelderly people, family \\ngroups \\n0 9 27 \\n0 7 21 \\n0.5 15 \\n0 6 60 \\n06 60 \\n0.4 40 \\nBUILDING REGULATIONS \\nGeneral requirements for stairs in UK in Part H of Bldg reg: \\ni Must be landing at top and bottom with going not less than width of stair \\n(except at top of steps to an inward-opening external door where total \\nrise does not exceed 600). Landing must be unobstructed and, if \\ninternal, level; if external may slope atgradient upto 1:12. \\nii Max of 16 risers allowed in each flight. With very long stairways must \\nbe change of direction of 30° or more at landing after not more than 36 \\nrises in consecutive flights. Landings between flights must be level and \\nunobstructed, with going not less than width of stair. \\nClear headroom of 2000 must be maintained, measured vertically \\nfrom pitch line (line of nosings). \\niv Treads must be level, extend to complete width of stair, and be either \\nparallel or tapered (except that lowest 2 of stairway may be rounded). All \\nparallel treads must have same going; tapered treads must have same \\nrate of taper, narrow ends at same side, and same going when measured \\nin centre. \\nv Rises must be same throughout stairway. \\nvi Projection of nosings not exceed 15. \\nvii Continuous handrails required on any flight rising more than 600. \\nHeight must be 800—1 000 above pitch line. Rails required at both sides \\non stairs wider than 1 000. \\nvia Sum of going and twice rise must not be less than 550 and not more \\nthan 700. \\nix Except in dwellings, stairs wider than t 800 must be divided by \\nhandrails into sections not less than 1 000 and not more than 1 800 wide. \\nFIRE ESCAPE STAIRS \\nRequirements for escape stairs in UK given in number of statutory \\ndocuments. These include London Building Acts, Building Standards \\n(Scotland), Bldg Reg (England & Wales) and Fire Precautions Act 1971. \\nRequirements given also in statutes covering specific uses of bldg, \\nsuch as Factories Act 1961 and Offices, Shops & Railway Premises Act \\n1963. \\nIn general, fire escape stairs must be built within enclosed shaft with \\nwalls of given fire resistance and fr self-closing doors. Doors must open \\ninto shaft at all floors except final exit level; doorswings must not \\nobstruct flow of people already on staircase Stairs from upper floors \\nmust not continue in unobstructed flight past ground floor to basement. \\nWinders generally not permitted. In most other aspects requirements \\ngiven in recent British codes of practice related to those in bldg reg. \\nSection II of Part E of reg covers dwellings, office bldg and shops, and \\nrefers to Code of Practice CP3: Chapter IV for all instances except \\ncertain single-staircase bldg. Staircase widths for specified numbers of \\noccupants given in code. \\nSTAIRS FOR DISABLED \\nExternal stairs particularly dangerous for elderly and disabled in bad \\nweather. On internal stairs splayed treads should be avoided. There \\nshould be no open risers; splayed risers with slightly-rounded nosings \\npreferable to undercut square nosings. Handrails should be provided on \\nboth sides of staircase; section of rail that is gripped should be rounded. \\nwith width about 50. Rails should be continuous at landings and extend \\nat least 300 beyond top of stairs; height should be about 850 above pitch \\nline. Max gradient should be 40°: 35° or less better.

In public bldg there should be sufficient space for \\nanother person to accompany chair-bound: 1400 mm depth, 1100 \\nwidth. In special residential homes large wheelchairs need to be accom- \\nmodated; dimensions for these: 1 800 depth, 1 000 width, 800 door \\nopening. ANSI standards —(1 )(2). \\nElevator cars must be accurate in levelling at landings; must not accelerate \\nor brake with jerk, requirements which dictate use of either variable- \\nvoltage traction motors or electro-hydraulic elevators. Doors should \\nclose slowly (0.3 m/s residential homes, 0.5 rn/s elsewhere); photo- \\nelectric devices to prevent premature closing desirable. \\nControl buttons should light to operate. For general purposes normal \\nvertical layout is best, with buttons at 30 centres mm spacing. Mean \\nheight should be 1 400, max 1 600. In bldg used by unaccompanied \\nwheelchair users controls should not be higher than 1 300. In residential \\nhomes horizontal arrangement of control buttons in cars can be desirable, \\nat height 1 050 and set in wall at least 600 back from door. \\nAt landings floor numbers should be very clearly indicated. To position \\nwheelchairs there should be clear space at least 1 500 x 1 500 before \\neach lift door. \\nPLANNING \\nElevators serving single zone of upper floor should be grouped in plan \\nwith interlinked controls. Arrangement of lobbies should allow waiting \\npassenger move rapidly to whichever car arrives first. No more than 4 \\nelevator entrances should be alongside each other; facing entrances \\nshould be 2500—3500 apart. Elevator entrances should not lie on \\nopposite sides of circulation route—+(3). \\nIn large bldg lobby area tends to be 5—6 m2 per elevator on upper floors \\nand 15—20 m2 per elevator at ground floor with single group of elevators. \\nFor efficient performances under heavy flows of traffic numbers of stops \\nmade by elevator cars should be kept to mm. In large bldg there should \\nbe single main loading floor; passengers entering bldg at other levels \\nshould be brought by secondary circulation to main lobby at ground level. Use of elevators for mail deliveries or for other interfloor traffic at \\npeak arrival or departure periods should be discouraged. \\nIn residential bldg and hotels noise to be generated by elevators must \\nbe considered at early planning stage.
